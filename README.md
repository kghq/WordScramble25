I am making this app as a part of the 100 Days of SwiftUI curriculum (Project 5). This is a refresher, as I've already finished the course. Now I focus on stuff I forgot or only partially understand, and improve the app in the ways that were not yet covered in the course. After finishing the app alongside the course guidelines, I've refactored it to MVVM, and made some minor improvements. I'm planning to add persistence with FileManager, and later maybe even fool around with SwiftData.
